# Book Search

## Description
This is a book search engine and list maker using React and Apollo. GraphQL is accessible at http://localhost:3001/graphql if ran locally. By using this, I am able to add, remove users and perform searches for books. This gave me practice on how to route with Apollo, even though as of right now, I am having difficulties routing the front-end.


## Installation

This project requires the installation of:
 - Node.js
 - NPM
 - Express.js
 - React
 - Bootstrap
 - Apollo
